## this site
is built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a lightweight static site generator. I decided to use a static generator to focus on content first. My secondary goal was
to get into the [10kb club](https://10kbclub.com/), which meant keeping the zipped bundle size `<`10kb.

This site is generated with no front-end JavaScript at all--reducing client-load and decreasing network latency and load times.

App dependencies:
- HTML
- CSS

Dev dependencies:
- 11ty: static site generator tool
- Nunjucks: content templating
- Markdown: content
